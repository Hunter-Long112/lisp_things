# lisp_things

This is just a place where I put anything lisp that I work on. I am by no means proficient nor do I expect to 
ever actually use lisp in my life, but I do find it extremely interesting. 

As of today (09/07/2021) there are two lisp files in this repository, and both were assignments from when I 
took programming languages (CS-3723) at UTSA.
